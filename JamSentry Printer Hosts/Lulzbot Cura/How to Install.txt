This is software for the Cura Lulzbot Software.
It is compatible with versions as far back as 19.12 (maybe farther, but I didn't check)

You will replace one python module in the Cura software.
The cura software is in a folder named Cura_xx.yy (where xx.yy is the version number)
For Windows machines this is generally in C:/Program Files (x86).

Within the Cura_xx.yy go to Cura/util/printerConnection

rename the file serialConnection.py to serialConnectionOld.py
copy the new serialConnection.py file into that folder

Restart Cura.  When the print window comes up the first time, the firewall program may prompt you to allow the connection.
This is because Cura is now listening for a Pause command from JamSentry.  Say yes (private networks is ok)

Note: Cura will listen on the port 27100 + the numerical part of the COM or TTY port.  If none, it will just listen on 27100.
JamSentry should be configured to send on this port.  It expects the default password, so no password change is required.

If you don't want to use the default password, then change it in the serialConnection.py code and match it in JamSentry.
